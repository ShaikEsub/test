To create a pull request for a public git repo, you need to follow these steps:

-   Fork the repo that you want to contribute to. This will create a copy of the repo under your own GitHub account.Â You can fork a repo by clicking theÂ **Fork**Â button on the top right corner of the repo page.
-   Clone your forked repo to your local machine.Â You can do this by runningÂ **`git clone <https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git`**>Â in your terminal, whereÂ **`your-username`**Â is your GitHub username andÂ **`repo-name`**Â is the name of the repo you forked.
-   Create a new branch for your changes.Â You can do this by runningÂ **`git checkout -b branch-name`**, whereÂ **`branch-name`**Â is a descriptive name for your branch.
-   Make your changes in the new branch. You can use any code editor or IDE that you prefer.Â You can also use GitHub Desktop to manage your changes.
-   Add and commit your changes to the new branch.Â You can do this by runningÂ **`git add .`**Â to stage all your changes andÂ **`git commit -m "message"`**Â to commit them with a message, whereÂ **`message`**Â is a brief summary of what you did.
-   Push your changes to your forked repo on GitHub.Â You can do this by runningÂ **`git push origin branch-name`**, whereÂ **`branch-name`**Â is the name of your branch.
-   Create a pull request from your forked repo to the original repo. You can do this by going to your forked repo on GitHub and clicking theÂ **Compare & pull request**Â button. This will open a page where you can review your changes and add a title and a description for your pull request.Â You can also link your pull request to an issue if there is one related to your changes.Â Then clickÂ **Create pull request**Â to submit it.

That's it!Â You have created a pull request for a public git repo. Now you need to wait for the maintainers of the original repo to review and merge your pull request. They might also ask you for some feedback or changes before merging it. You can communicate with them through the comments section of your pull request.
